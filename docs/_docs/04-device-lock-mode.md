excerpt: "How to lock the Yamaha Reface CP to control a specific Ableton Live device."

Turn *on* the Tremolo switch (up position) to enable the Device Lock Mode. 
This locks the currently selected device so the 8 right-most knobs of the Reface can be used to control that specific device even when the selection in Live changes afterwards.

While a device is locked, the **Wave type knob** can be used to select the device parameter bank from 1 (Rdl) to 5 (Toy).
Wave type 6 (CP) is reserved to select the [Device Randomization Mode]({{ "/docs/device-randomization-mode/" | relative_url }})
