---

This mode allows using the Yamaha Reface CP note keys to play quantized note repetitions while the keys are held down in a similar way as other control surfaces (such as Push) do with the pads.

Turn *on* the D.Delay switch (up position) to enable the Note Repeat Mode.

When enabled, the MIDI notes from the keyboard are repeated automatically while they're pressed according a repetition rate. 

The following controls apply in this mode:

| Control | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Wave Type** | Set MIDI Transmit channel |
| **Delay Depth** | Set the note repeat rate by specifying the number of notes per bar |
| **Delay Time** | Set the note repeat rate using fixed quantization values from 1/32T to 1 bar |

**Tip:** Selecting the track/device mode after enabling the note repeat allows using the knobs for automation and the note repeat functionality at the same time. To change the note repeat settings again using the knobs it needs to be disabled and enabled again.
