RefaceCPLiveControl is installed as a *Remote Script* in Ableton Live.

This ensures the Reface CP can be used as a *Control Surface* in Live in a similar way as other controllers do, bringing new controls to the application itself automatically and anytime, regardless of the opened Live Set document.

## How to install

1. Manually create a folder called `Remote Scripts` within your User Library if it does not already exist. The default User Library locations are:
   - **Windows:** `\Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library`
   - **Mac:** `Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library`

2. Download the the script:<br><br>
[<i class="fas fa-download"></i> Download RefaceCPLiveControl](https://github.com/yannxou/RefaceCPLiveControl/archive/master.zip){: .btn .btn--success}

3. Place the remote script folder called `RefaceCP` from the download archive into the `Remote Scripts` from previous step. 

4. Open Ableton Live and select the `Reface CP` control surface script in the `Link, Tempo & MIDI` settings.
