1. Manually create a folder called `Remote Scripts` within your User Library if it does not already exist. The default User Library locations are:

   - **Windows:** `\Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library`
   - **Mac:** `Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library`
   
2. Place the remote script folder called `RefaceCP` (the folder you found this README.md in) into the `Remote Scripts` from previous step. 

3. Select the `Reface CP` control surface script in Live's `Link, Tempo & MIDI` settings.
