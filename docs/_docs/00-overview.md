excerpt: "Introduction to the RefaceCPLiveControl script for Ableton Live."
---

RefaceCPLiveControl is an Ableton Live Control Surface script for the Yamaha Reface CP keyboard.

It makes use of the different available controls (knobs, toggles and midi keys) in the Reface CP keyboard to control different features in Ableton Live and perform many actions.

There are many different control modes that can be selected with the toggle controls (tremolo, chorus, delay) in the Reface CP.
The different knobs in the Reface CP are mapped automatically to specific Live parameters or features depending on the active mode.
