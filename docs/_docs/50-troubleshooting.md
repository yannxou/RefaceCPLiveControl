## Reface CP speaker not producing any sound

In case your Reface CP does not produce any sound after using the script you can restore it to factory defaults by holding down the right-most C-key on the keyboard while pressing the Power (Standby/On) switch to turn it on. 

This could happen in case of application crash or if the device is disconnected before closing Live. To avoid this, make sure Live application is always closed first before turning off the Reface. The script will restore the settings (like the speaker output) automatically when closing.
