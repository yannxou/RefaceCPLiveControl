RefaceCPLiveControl is an Ableton Live Control Surface script for the Yamaha Reface CP keyboard.

## Constraints

Sadly, the Reface CP does not send any MIDI CC for the Volume and Octave faders. It's also a pity that the Type knob is not an endless encoder. This limits the possibilities of what could be achieved when used as a controller but I hope this still brings a new dimension to your great Reface CP. 

Control surface scripting in Ableton Live can be very powerful but I found some limitations that I wish are added in the future. For instance:

* Being able to define a mapping of MIDI notes so a particular MIDI note key is processed in Live's input as another MIDI note. That'd be a better way to implement a scale mode for a keyboard where notes outside a given scale would be mapped to another note in that scale. Muting those notes (by capturing their events in the script) is the only way I've been able to do this.

* Integrated MIDI effect chain. Similarly to how the `note_repeat` works, it would be awesome to have access to standard MIDI effects like velocity, note repeat, arpeggiator, etc so they could be configured from the script and the chain's output sent to Live to record the notes directly. This feature actually would solve the need for the previous point by just having access to a scale device.

## Troubleshooting

In case your Reface CP does not produce any sound after using the script you can restore it to factory defaults by holding down the right-most C-key on the keyboard while pressing the Power (Standby/On) switch. This could happen in case of application crash or if the device is disconnected before closing Live. To avoid this, make sure Live application is closed before turning off the Reface. The script will restore the settings (like the speaker output) automatically when closing.

## Support

This script has been developed and tested while using Live 12. I cannot guarantee that it works correctly in previous versions.

If you'd like to receive support, please send your feedback in the form of suggestions or bug reporting using the github issues.

If youâ€™d like to send support for this project or other hundreds of ideas you can bring the drinks using the button below.
I will happily implement something similar for other synths if I receive enough feedback or someone gifts me a unit.

You can also just star this project if you find it useful. This might serve as a quick feedback and encourage me to add more features.
