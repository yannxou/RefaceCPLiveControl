This allows changing the selected track's volume, panning, sends A and B as well as the Mute, Solo and Arm buttons. 

In this mode the `Drive` knob is connected to the currently selected parameter in Live which can be very handy for quick automations.

The following controls apply in this mode:

| Control | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Wave Type** | Set MIDI Transmit channel |
| **Drive** | Current selected parameter |
| **Tremolo Depth** | Selected track volume |
| **Tremolo Rate** | Selected track panning |
| **Chorus Depth** | Selected track send A |
| **Chorus Speed** | Selected track send B |
| **Delay Depth** | Selected track mute |
| **Delay Time** | Selected track solo |
| **Reverb Depth** | Selected track arm |
