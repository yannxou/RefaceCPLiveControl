RefaceCPLiveControl is a script for Ableton Live that allows using the Yamaha Reface CP keyboard as a control surface.

## How it started

After several years owning a Yamaha Reface CP and being a fan of it for its portability and sound I thought it would be cool to use it as a controller for Ableton Live so I wouldn't have to carry more stuff just to control a few things in Live. 

Once the first things started working it was very engaging and somewhat inevitable to keep thinking about adding more features.

## How it's going

More features are planned but this is a side project and I need some spare time to work on those. There are also limitations that prevent implementing some ideas, like the Reface CP not sending MIDI CC for Volume and Octave faders or certain aspects of Live that are not possible to control from the script at this time. 

But some new features will be progressively added, maybe I even try to port this to other Reface models if I can get my hands on them. To some extent I will look at the project's success to see whether it's worth it or not.
